# ML-Project
This is Cody Nichols' and Carlos Rabat's Machine Learning (COMP-6630-001) Final Project.

## Main Idea
The main idea of this project was to create machine learning models to predict bankruptcy on a dataset from the UCI ML Repo. In the end, we created MLP, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree models that predicted bankruptcy. Check out the individual ".ipynb" files for more information on each model. Some of those files have some Markdown included in them to further explain the code and the results that have been gathered.
